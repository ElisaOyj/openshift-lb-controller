# F5 route controller


## Fresh F5 install

1. create one node per openshift cluster. Use clustername as name, and router ip address as address
2. create virtual servers, one for port 80 and one for 443.
3. add wildcard certificates to virtualservers
4. create irule (see example)
5. deploy irules to each virtualserver

Example of what irule looks like:

```
when HTTP_REQUEST {
    HTTP::header remove X-Forwarded-For
    HTTP::header remove X-Forwarded-Inet

    HTTP::header insert X-Forwarded-Inet [IP::version]
    HTTP::header insert X-Forwarded-For "[getfield [IP::remote_addr] % 1]"

    set host [getfield [HTTP::header host] ":" 1]
    set port [TCP::local_port]
    append host "_$port"
    if { [catch {pool $host} id ] } {
      HTTP::respond 404 content "Application not found"
    } else {
      pool $host
    }
}

when LB_SELECTED {
    if { [LB::server priority] == 15 } {
      persist none
    }
}
```

### Deploy to cluster

if this is fresh install, check fresh install instructions first

1. `oc create secret generic f5 --from-literal=username=userhere --from-literal=password=passwordhere`
2. `oc create -f examples/controller.yaml` (modify environment variables first)

#### Environment variables

| Variable | Explanation    |
| ------------- |-------------|
| PROVIDER | Load balancer provider name, in this case F5 |
| SUFFIXHOST | suffix of the host what we are interested. For instance if we have wildcard *.dc.example.com we are interested of dc.example.com |
| CLUSTER_PRIO | priority of this node. This affects only to poolpga things, this value should not be same in all clusters |
| CLUSTERALIAS | name of the cluster (and node in f5 nodes) |
| PARTITION | name of the partition that f5 should use for this controller (if not defined Common is used) |
| F5_ADDR | address of F5 api |
| F5_USER | username of F5 api |
| F5_PASSWORD | password of F5 api |

## Route annotations

These annotations can be added to each route in Openshift configuration, and it will modify monitoring accordingly.


| Annotation key | Default    | Type |
| ------------- |-------------| ----- |
| route.elisa.fi/path      | / | string |
| route.elisa.fi/method      | GET | string |
| route.elisa.fi/lbmethod | round-robin | string, look methods below |
| route.elisa.fi/poolpga | disabled | integer |
| route.elisa.fi/lbenabled | | string |
| route.elisa.fi/prio | 1 | integer |
| route.elisa.fi/role | | string |

### Possible loadbalancing methods in F5:

- round-robin
- ratio-member 
- least-connections-member
- observed-member
- predictive-member
- ratio-node
- least-connections-node
- fastest-node
- observed-node
- predictive-node
- dynamic-ratio-node
- fastest-app-response
- least-sessions
- dynamic-ratio-member
- ratio-session
- ratio-least-connections-member
- ratio-least-connections-node


## Example active/standby:

In active cluster route you should have following annotations:
```
  annotations:
    route.elisa.fi/role: "active"
```

And in standby:

```
  annotations:
    route.elisa.fi/role: "standby"
```


## Custom hosts to F5 (other than `SUFFIXHOST`)

There is possibility to add another hosts than suffixhost to F5. For instance if you want add `foobar.com` route to be exposed through F5, you need to add annotation `route.elisa.fi/lbenabled` to route, the value of annotation does not matter it can be empty (`''`). Please remember that if you need certificates for this host, it needs to be added to F5 manually.
